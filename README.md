<h3>Deep Learning final project</h3>
1. Human Activity Recognition Data Set<br>
2. Loading (load and confirm whether it is suitable for building model)<br>
3. Analysis (use diagrams to illustrate each of the six activities and three accerlator file)<br>
4. 1D CNN (the model that teacher want us to use)<br>
5. Neural Designer (reference)<br>
