<h3>Deep Learning final project</h3>
1. Human Activity Recognition Data Set
2. Loading (load and confirm whether it is suitable for building model)
3. Analysis (use diagrams to illustrate each of the six activities and three accerlator file)
4. 1D CNN (the model that teacher want us to use)
5. Neural Designer (reference)
